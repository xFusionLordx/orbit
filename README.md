## Requirements

- Wayland compositor with layer-shell support (Hyprland, Sway, etc.)
- NetworkManager
- BlueZ
- GTK4 & gtk4-layer-shell

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
# Using paru
paru -S orbit-wifi

# Using yay
yay -S orbit-wifi
```

After installation, enable the background daemon:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now orbit
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LifeOfATitan/orbit.git
cd orbit
cargo build --release
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/orbit /usr/bin/orbit
# Install systemd service
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp orbit.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now orbit
```

## Usage

```bash
# Toggle visibility
orbit toggle [position]

# Show the window
orbit show

# Hide the window
orbit hide

# Open specific tab directly
orbit toggle --tab [wifi|bluetooth|vpn]

# Output status in JSON for Waybar
orbit waybar-status

# Manually trigger a theme reload
orbit reload-theme

# Reload config without restarting
orbit reload-config

# Run as daemon (handled automatically by systemd)
orbit daemon

# List WiFi networks in terminal
orbit list
```

## Waybar Integration

Orbit is designed to look native in your bar. Add the following module to your Waybar `config.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"custom/orbit": {
    "exec": "orbit waybar-status",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 10,
    "on-click": "orbit toggle top-right",
    "format": "󱗿"
}
```

## Configuration

### Config File (`~/.config/orbit/config.toml`)

```toml
# Window position on screen
position = "top-right"

# Margins (in pixels) from screen edges
margin_top = 10
margin_bottom = 10
margin_left = 10
margin_right = 10

# Animation (optional)
# Window transitions: slidedown, slideup, slideleft, slideright, swingdown, swingup, swingleft, swingright, fade, crossfade, none
window_transition = "slidedown"
window_transition_duration = 200

# Tab switching transitions: slidehorizontal, slidevertical, slidedown, slideup, slideleft, slideright, crossfade, none
stack_transition = "slidehorizontal"
stack_transition_duration = 200
```

### Theme File (`~/.config/orbit/theme.toml`)

```toml
accent_primary = "#8b5cf6"
accent_secondary = "#06b6d4"
background = "#1e1e2e"
foreground = "#d4d4d8"
destructive = "#ef4444"
opacity = 0.91
```

`accent_primary_foreground` is computed automatically (white on dark accents, dark on light accents), but can be overridden:

```toml
accent_primary_foreground = "#ffffff"
```

### Custom Style Override (`~/.config/orbit/style.css`)

Drop a custom `style.css` in the config directory to override or extend the generated theme. GTK4 CSS classes include `.orbit-panel`, `.orbit-network-row`, `.orbit-button`, `.orbit-tab`, and more. This file is loaded after the dynamic theme and takes precedence.
